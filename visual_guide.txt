1. Distribution & Outlier Analysis
Before you can catch fraud, you need to know what a "normal" transaction looks like.

Transaction Amount by Class: Create a boxplot or a density plot (KDE) comparing Transaction_Amount for Fraud vs. Non-Fraud.

The Insight: Does fraud happen at specific price points (e.g., very high amounts or very small "test" amounts)?

Account Balance vs. Amount: Scatter plot of Account_Balance against Transaction_Amount.

The Insight: Is it common for fraudulent transactions to "drain" an account? Look for points where the transaction amount is very close to the total balance.

2. Categorical "Hotspots"
Some categories are naturally more prone to fraud.

Merchant Category & Fraud Rate: A bar chart showing the percentage of fraud per Merchant_Category.

The Insight: Are "Electronics" or "Jewelry" high-risk compared to "Groceries"? This is a prime candidate for One-Hot Encoding or Target Encoding.

Device Type & Transaction Device: Does fraud happen more on "Mobile" vs. "Desktop"?

The Insight: If 80% of fraud happens on a specific Device_Type, this feature has high predictive power.

3. Temporal (Time-Based) Patterns
Fraudsters often operate at specific times to avoid detection or exploit system lags.

Fraud by Hour of Day: Extract the hour from Transaction_Time and plot a histogram.

The Insight: Do fraudulent transactions spike at 3:00 AM while legitimate ones peak at 12:00 PM?

Transaction Frequency (Velocity): Plot the number of transactions per Customer_ID over a short window (e.g., 24 hours).

The Insight: Fraud often involves "bursts" of many transactions in a few minutes. This is a huge hint for feature engineering (e.g., creating a transactions_in_last_hour column).

4. Geographical & Logical Scope
Using your new Transaction_Scope and City columns.

Scope vs. Fraud: A stacked bar chart of Domestic vs. International transactions colored by Is_Fraud.

The Insight: Is International scope a strong indicator of risk?

State-Level Risk Map: If you have enough data, a choropleth map (Heatmap) of the USA by State.

The Insight: Are certain states "hubs" for fraudulent activity?

5. Feature Correlation
Finally, you need to see how all these numerical values dance together.

Correlation Heatmap: Include Age, Transaction_Amount, Account_Balance, and your target Is_Fraud.

The Insight: You want to find features that correlate strongly with Is_Fraud but not with each other (to avoid redundancy).
