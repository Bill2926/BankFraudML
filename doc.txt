- Finished kMedoids model and also testing it using: Elbow method, Silhouette and Medoids' centre to discover the "why"
- Rearranged the project folder for a more professional looks:)
- Initiate the fastapi framework and uvicorn

Locked-in: K-Means Clustering and RandomForest

I dont want to change/synthesize the og dataset too much so I've switch to this: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/bank-transaction-dataset-for-fraud-detection

03/02/2026:
- I shift my approach to Visual Evidence-Based Feature Engineering => look at visuals first then FE
- I modified the dataset to USA-based

01/02/2026:
- I found a problem is that the og dataset has granularity problem => every userID are unique therefore
- I cant FE things like how many trans in an hour or spending deviation => fixed with script
- Further looks into dts Account_Type: checking (daily use, no interest), savings (has interest, not meant to be used), business (large transfer/amount)
- Fix the Account_Balance col

Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marusagar/bank-transaction-fraud-detection
I've slowed down my working with the use of Jupyter notebook to see how the data changes => in a good way
Things changed:
1. changed the transaction location cols to domestic and international
2. changed the currency to VND (USD, AUD and CNY)
3. changed the bank_branch to Vietnamese banks (some inter too)
4. drop "State" col and change the city value into Vietnamese cities
Today features importance graph analysis:
1. Time is Everything: The top 4 features are all time periods (Night, Noon, Evening, Morning). 
This suggests that the time of day is the strongest indicator of whether a transaction is fraudulent in your dataset. 
Night-time transactions appear to be the most suspicious => but also maybe "frequency bias"
2. User Profile Matters: Account_Type and Gender are the next most influential. 
It seems certain account types are more prone to fraud, or the model has found a specific behavioral pattern associated with them.
3. Behavioral Context: Transaction_Type and Merchant_Category are mid-range. 
This makes sense; buying expensive jewelry (category) or a sudden large transfer (type) are classic fraud signals.
4. Low Impact: Surprisingly, Transaction_Amount and Account_Balance are relatively low on the list. 
Usually, these are much higher. 
This might mean that in your specific dataset, the timing and context of the spend are more unusual than the amount itself.
I also learnt about "function engineering"

27/01/2026:
The confi score is still too high => maybe because of data leakage
or the number of 1 for isFraud is still too low. I've changed the dataset to a
much larger one.
Goal: is to handle Class Imbalance (not enough fraud cases) => use SMOTE

1. User Baseline (3–4 features): You have Transaction_Amount, but you need to know if that amount is normal for that specific user.Example: Amount / User_Avg_Amount.
2. Temporal Anomalies (2–3 features): You have velocity_6h, but adding time_since_last_transaction helps catch "account takeover" spikes.
3. Location/Device Logic (2 features): Even though you pruned City, a feature like is_new_city (binary) is more precise than a list of 500 city names.
4. Interaction Features (2 features): Combining two features into one, like the savings_monetary_risk ($is\_savings\_attack \times Transaction\_Amount$), helps the model identify "high-stakes" fraud specifically.
